This is my personal project which me & my friends made a reality. My friends make the chassis & the whole body & also connected all the electronics & integrated those into the body of the vehicle. I personally developed an android app to control the vehicle communicating with the bluetooth onboard the vehicle, which in turn communicating with the Arduino onboard. The arduino operated all the electronics on the vehicle.
